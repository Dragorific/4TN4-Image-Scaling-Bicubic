# Bicubic Image Scaling in Python

This repository was done for **CE4TN4** as a laboratory project. 

The python code contains the functions for **downscaling and _bicubic_ upscaling** a jpeg image. It was achieved without using any helper library functions except for reading and writing image files with OpenCV and NumPy. 

###### Purpose
This lab project demonstrates an understanding of image manipulation and processing at a mathematical level.


###### Notes
There is some level of artifacting present in the images that comes as a result of interpolating to a high enough resolution. At current, there are methods to filter the output upscaled image to remove the artifacts.
